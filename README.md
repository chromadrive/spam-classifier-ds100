# spam-classifier-ds100

I developed a spam/ham classifier for my data science class using scikit-learn and pandas. As part of an in-class Kaggle prediction competition, my classifier scored a 99.6% on the private dataset of emails, and as a result, I placed 15th out of roughly 200 submissions on the leaderboard.
